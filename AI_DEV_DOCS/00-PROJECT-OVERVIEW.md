## Code Organization Principles

1. **Maximum 400 lines per file** - Split larger files into logical modules
2. **Colocation** - Keep related files together (component + styles + tests)
3. **Single Responsibility** - Each file/function does one thing well
4. **Reusable Components** - Build a component library, not page-specific code
5. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
6. **Server Components by Default** - Use client components only when needed
